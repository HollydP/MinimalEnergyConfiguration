# MinimalEnergyConfiguration
Minimal energy configuration for charged particles in a circle using simulated annealing

Force: Simplified coulombs law which describes the attraction and repulsive force between charged particles.

Tasks:
(Test) Find the optimal configuration upto (excluding) 12 particles - 12 particles represents a magic number as the behaviour changes.
(Trial) Calculate the minimal configuration for 12+ particles

Questions:
How does behaviour change across different cooling schedules?
How does markov chain length affect convergence?
Is there a way to improve the neighbouring procedure?
